        <p>1. Based on everything we have gone over the things I noticed that were similar between Scratch and Python is the way that it uses functions and variables. 
        Even though they both usethe functions and variables similarly in the way you create them and call upon them, it is different because obviously, since Python
        is a written code rather than dragging and dropping blocks, it leaves more room for error. 
       
         2. Debugging was really annoying, but it is gratifying after you finally fix the problem. It was fine to debug because it is something you have to become accustomed to.
        Sometimes you make really obvious mistakes, but the ones that you really have to search for are the worst.</p>
