        <p>1. Based on everything we have gone over the things I noticed that were similar between Scratch and Python is the way that it uses functions and variables. 
        Even though they both usethe functions and variables similarly in the way you create them and call upon them, it is different because obviously, since Python
        is a written code rather than dragging and dropping blocks, it leaves more room for error.</p> 
       
        <p> 2. Debugging was really annoying, but it is gratifying after you finally fix the problem. It was fine to debug because it is something you have to become accustomed to.
        Sometimes you make really obvious mistakes, but the ones that you really have to search for are the worst.</p>

          <p> Today we go to make the choose your own path game and it was really fun. Working with Nabeeha was cool because we both helped</p>
          <p>eachother when we got stuck. I also learned how to make a program in python work properly which was pretty cool. </p>

            <p>A list is a set of data that is arranged and it can be accessed when it's called on with brackets[].</p>
            <p>It's useful because you can store a bunch of data and if you need to randomize it is super easy to do so. </p>
            <p>I really worked well with Isabel because I think we were able to freely express our love for our boi Ed Sheeran.</p>
            <p>Since we shared such a large common interest it was easy to agree on what we were doing.</p>
            <p><font color = 'green'> Ed Sheeran <3! </font></p>

              <p>The trip today to Refinary29 was a lot of fun. My group was the shopping team and I think we all got to work together</p>
              <p>in a way that was effective. I think that the trip changed my perspective of R29 because I honestly thought it was a place that helped</p>
              <p>enforce the standards that society sets on women, but I was apparently very wrong.</p>

                <h3>7-21</h3>
                <p>Today when we made our roulette programs, everything was going well until I had to add the money.</p>
                <p>I only really struggled with that because before I created the program I made a map of everything I had to do.</p>
                <p>Doing this made the process easier and it allowed me to work through any trouble I got into step by step.</p>

                <p> My view on robots didn't really change much. I feel like I got a better understanding of what a robot is.</p>
                <p>I am nervous about what the future of technology will hold because technology is becoming more and more invasive.</p>
                <p> I feel like next time we can communicate better, but other than that it was pretty good. </p>

                <p>TOday we got to play with different ways to turn on the lights</p>
                <p>It was cool to make the lights do different patterns and designs, and getting the photoresistor to work was hella annoying. </p>
                <p> Our glow and grow would be: We worked together really well as a team </p>
                <p>but I think if we were better at not being defeated easily we would've gotten it quicker.</p>

                <p>Today we got our robot's to move.</p>
                <p>Even though we got the neglected robot me and Febby managed to get it to work.</p>

                <p>For the last 2 days we have been working on binary search and bubble sort.</p>
                <p>Both had very easy to grasp concepts, but actually getting the code to work proved itself to be challenging.</p>
                <p>I was able to get them to work by referencing other code from the internet.</p>
